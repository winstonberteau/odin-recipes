    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you’re looking for the ultimate outrageous dessert experience, look no further than Deep Fried Oreos. This State Fair Favorite is just 5 ingredients (plus powdered sugar for dusting) and couldn’t be easier to make. The secret ingredient? Pancake mix!</p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong></ul>
    <li>1 cup of milk</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup dry pancake mix</li>
    <li>1 18.71-oz package Double Stuf Oreos</li>
    <li>2 qts of vegetable oil</li>
    <li>powdered sugar for topping</li>
    <ol><strong>Steps</strong></ol>
    <li>Line a plate or baking sheet with paper towels. In a large bowl, whisk together milk, egg, and pancake mix until smooth. If runny, add more pancake mix, 1 tablespoon at a time, until thickened</li>
    <li>In a Dutch oven, deep pot, or deep fryer, heat oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Working in batches (I do 4 to 6 Oreos at a time), dip Oreos in batter, allowing excess to drip back into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Fry until golden brown on one side, about 1 to 2 minutes. Flip each cookie and continue to cook until golden brown on the second side. Drain on paper towels and dust with powdered sugar.</li>
